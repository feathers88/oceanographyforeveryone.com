[Link] (http://oceanographyforeveryone.com/): Oceanography for Everyone

###Background

Oceanography for Everyone is the community portal for our DIY oceanography community. 

###Overview

The ocean belongs to us all, but the tools necessary to study, explore, and understand the ocean are rarely accessible to the vast majority of ocean users. By nurturing a community of low-cost, open-source hardware developers, scientists, and ocean stakeholders, we want to change that.

Whether you're a researcher looking for alternatives to expensive scientific gear, a citizen scientist interested in building a monitoring program, a fisherman exploring new tools to understand their catch, or an ocean enthusiast seeking new ways to interact with the sea, this community is for you.

Under each project, you will find links to resources, build guides, 3D-printer files, code repositories, and, eventually, databases. Each section project will also point you towards ways that you can help contribute to the project. We have assembled a Parts Depot with links to the commercial products used to build each tool.

The ocean belongs to everyone. Let’s ensure that we have access to the tools needed to understand it.

###How you can help

In keeping with the spirit of Oceanography for Everyone, we've made the source-code for the community portal open to anyone. If you see a problem, bug, or accessibility issue, please feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
